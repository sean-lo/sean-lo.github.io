We propose the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) as a general model for electrified routing operations, with applications in trucking for long-haul logistics, robotics, and machine scheduling. The EVRP admits a path-based set-partitioning formulation with infinitely many variables, due to the presence of both discrete routing decisions (as in VRP) and continuous charging decisions (new to EVRP). We develop a two-level label-setting algorithm for the pricing problem arising in column generation, which generates non-dominated subpaths and stitches them together. In so doing, we propose a new paradigm of domination for paths and subpaths, which ensures finite convergence and correctness of column generation even with infinitely many variables. We demonstrate how two-level label-setting can be applied to ng-route relaxations, via additional ng-set resources, and tighten these relaxations iteratively until one obtains elementary paths. We also demonstrate how our two-level label-setting can support cutting planes which strengthen the linear relaxation of EVRP, via additional cut resources. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to realistic problem sizes.
