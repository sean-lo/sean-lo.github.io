A critical challenge in transportation decarbonization lies in the electrification of long-haul operations along highways. To support this transition, this paper tackles the electric vehicle routing problem, and proposes a modelling and algorithmic approach to solve it without time or charge discretization. Starting with column generation for the path-based set-partitioning formulation, we develop a novel algorithm for the pricing subproblem which generates and stitches together non-dominated subpaths. We also use ng-route relaxations iteratively, expanding neighborhoods until one obtains elementary paths. Lastly, we apply cuts which strengthen the linear relaxation and show how the pricing problem can be solved including new duals from these cuts. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to realistic problem sizes.
