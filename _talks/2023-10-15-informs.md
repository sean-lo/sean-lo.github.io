A critical challenge in transportation decarbonization lies in the electrification of long-haul operations along highways. To support this transition, this paper tackles the electric vehicle routing problem, and proposes a modeling and algorithmic approach to solve it without time or charge discretization. Starting with column generation for the path-based set-partitioning formulation, we develop a novel algorithm for the pricing subproblem which generates and stitches together non-dominated subpaths. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to realistic problem sizes. We demonstrate the value of optimization charging and routing decisions jointly, compared to a business-as-usual heuristic.
