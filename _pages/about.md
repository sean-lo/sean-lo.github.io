Welcome to my webpage! I am a first-year PhD student in Operations Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Advised by Prof. Alexandre Jacquillat, I am interested in developing fast, scalable algorithms in discrete optimization for logistics and transport.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the horn, jogging, and drinking at the pub.

My resume can be found [here]().
