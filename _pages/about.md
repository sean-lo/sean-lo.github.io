Welcome to my webpage! I am a third-year PhD student in Operations Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Advised by [Prof. Alexandre Jacquillat](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/alexandre-jacquillat), I am interested in developing fast, scalable algorithms in discrete optimization, with applications in transportation, healthcare, and logistics.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the horn, running, and hiking.
